overrides this field. If both SettlType (63) and SettDate (64) are

.PP
Regular is defined as the default settlement period for the
particular security on the exchange of execution.

In Fixed Income the contents of this field may influence the
instrument definition if the SecurityID (48) is ambiguous. In the
US an active Treasury offering may be re-opened, and for a time one
CUSIP will apply to both the current and "when-issued" securities.
Supplying a value of "7" clarifies the instrument description; any
other value or the absence of this field should cause the
respondent to default to the active issue.
