Host assigned entity ID that can be used to reference all
components of a cross; sides + strategy + legs. Used as the primary
key with which to refer to the Cross Order for cancellation and
replace. The HostCrossID will also be used to link together
components of the Cross Order. For example, each individual
Execution Report associated with the order will carry HostCrossID
in order to tie back to the original cross order.
